# database-journey
A user focused database website, where the users contribute movies, lets the user make 'watched lists', and recommends the user movies.

To start using the website be sure to use website.php to launch it. Using both the website and database might require XAMPP.

To create accounts use the "Register" button (password keep is unsecure at the moment so don't use any sensitive passwords).

To add movies to your watched list, click on them in the main page and click "Add to watched"

To add a new movie to the database use the "Add Movie" button

To search based on genre use the "Search For Movies" button

To request a movie suggestion use the "Suggest Movies" button. This will find watched lists that have the same movies that you clicked, and return the most common movies those other lists have.
